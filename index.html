                <h3>We First Met</h3>
                <p>We first met in a tuition class named Dipanita Mam's class. Fun fact: We never talked during that
                    time! Back then, I used to love teasing you, and Mam also used to tease you too. I'll never forget
                    that moment when I was eating chocolate, and you told Mam, "Mam! Sasanka da chocolate khachhe."
                    Seriously! We never even looked into each other's eyes back then. But when you laughed in tuition,
                    you looked so cute and innocent. I loved the way you smiled‚Äîit was kind of cute.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="event">
                <h3>Second Time We Met</h3>
                <p>The second time we met was at my uncle‚Äôs child‚Äôs annaprashan, a traditional ceremony that felt like
                    it was meant to be more than just an ordinary event. You looked absolutely stunning, the way you
                    carried yourself in that traditional attire. I couldn't take my eyes off you. I remember how we
                    exchanged glances, and in that moment, something deep inside me stirred. You gave me a beautiful,
                    shy smile, and that smile alone spoke volumes. It wasn‚Äôt until later that you told me you had a
                    crush on me at that time. Those words hit me like a wave, and I couldn‚Äôt help but feel like the
                    universe was giving us a sign. You said it felt like God‚Äôs hint, and in that instant, I realized
                    that something beautiful was unfolding between us. It wasn‚Äôt just the ceremony or the setting‚Äîit was
                    the magic in the air, the unspoken connection that neither of us could deny. I still remember that
                    moment like it was yesterday, as if it were the first chapter of a love story written just for us.

                <h3>Third Time We Met</h3>
                <p>The third time we met was at my school, the day I came to collect my TC certificate after completing
                    my schooling. It was supposed to be just a regular errand, but the moment I walked in, I saw you.
                    Our eyes met across the room, and in that instant, everything else faded away. It felt like time had
                    paused just for us. We smiled at each other, and it wasn‚Äôt just a smile‚Äîit was a shared moment, a
                    silent understanding that something beautiful was beginning between us. That smile wasn‚Äôt casual; it
                    was the kind of smile that speaks volumes without words, a smile that whispered of connection and
                    fate. It felt as though the universe had aligned to bring us together in that very moment. In that
                    brief exchange, I knew that what started as a simple meeting was something much more. It was the
                    start of something beautiful, something I‚Äôd hold onto forever.</p>

            <div class="event">
                <h3>Fourth Time We Met</h3>
                <p>We met again on Instagram, and that's when something inside me truly began to change. We started talking, and I still remember how you always hesitated to call me "Dada," something that felt so innocent yet special. But what truly touched my heart was the time when I had my brutal accident. In a world where everyone seems to care only about themselves, and even my so-called friends distanced themselves, you were the first one to message me. You cared enough to check on me constantly, asking for regular updates on my health, even when I was too stubborn to show it. Despite me being rude, distant, and cold, you never gave up on me. Your kindness and compassion cut through all my walls, and that‚Äôs when I realized that what I was feeling wasn‚Äôt just admiration‚Äîit was love.
            
                Since that day, we‚Äôve been in a long-distance relationship, and though the miles between us are countless, the bond we share is unbreakable. I poured my heart out to you and proposed, and though you rejected me at first, I never gave up. You rejected me not once, not twice, but 20 times a day, but every rejection only made me love you more, because deep down I knew you were worth the wait. Finally, after all the pain and all the waiting, you accepted me, and in that moment, my whole world changed. 
            
                Even in the distance, we‚Äôre not just two people crossing paths‚Äîwe‚Äôve become something deeper, something real. We became lovers, and I‚Äôll cherish every moment we've shared and every moment yet to come, no matter how far apart we may be.</p>
